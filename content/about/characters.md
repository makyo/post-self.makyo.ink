## RJ Brewster / AwDae (ey/em)

A sound tech for the Soho Theatre Troupe, RJ Brewster was among the lost in the early 2100s. Ey, along with Dr. Carter Ramirez, was instrumental in bringing to light the origin of the lost and ending that whole saga. As a member of the furry subculture, ey commonly appeared online (and while lost) as an agender anthropomorphic fennec. Ey focused strongly on making eir avatar (or av) as realistic as possible, down to the inability to form the same consonants that a human mouth would. Ey was instrumental in the creation of the System, <span class="spoiler">being the first semi-successful upload; while ey did not wind up living to see the System, eir consciousness formed the foundation of the System itself, described early on as a half-sensed presence within the System. Eir friend Sasha, so torn by eir loss and confronted by eir sensed presence after uploading, used eir poem Ode to the End of Death for the names of her forks. Early political circumstances required that her relationship with em be kept secret, leading to a near pathological obsession with keeping eir Name from being known.</span><i class="spoiler-warn"></i>

## Michelle Hadje<span class="spoiler"> / Sasha</span><i class="spoiler-warn"></i>

Michelle Hadje uploaded early on during the System's creation and is considered one of the founders and a member of the Council of Eight along with Debarre, Zeke/Ezekiel, Jonas Anderson, user11824, and the three nameless Sino-Russian Bloc representatives.

She is best known for being the founder of the Ode clade, and is no longer extant on the System as of 2306.

Due to her experience while lost, her and her up-tree instances have a 'unique relationship to language' that primarily manifests with a lack of contractions, florid speech with occasionally irregular word order (anaphora using dative/ablative fronting, e.g: "I set up *for myself* an archetype"), and well-placed uses of the word 'fuck'. She and her clade deal with the effects even within the System and will occasionally describe themselves as 'mad', for lack of a better term. <span class="spoiler">Additionally, the experience left her struggling to maintain a single form post-uploading, often alternating between skunk and human form, which is described as extremely unpleasant.</span><i class="spoiler-warn"></i>

### The Ode clade

The Ode clade consists of, nominally, 100 instances. In 2124, Michelle forked ten instances from herself corresponding to the ten first lines of the stanzas of the "Ode to the end of death". From there, those ten instances were free to fork as they would, and each quickly picked up on interests as they went.

*Note:* Given the unwieldy names, many Odists go by shorter versions, which are shown with *italics*.

#### *Dear*, Also, The Tree That Was Felled (it/its)

Dear is an instance artist, meaning that it plays around with the meaning of self in a world where one can create multiple copies of oneself. It was instrumental in the investigation of the events as described in the Bălan clade's *On the Perils of Memory*. It takes the form of a fennec fox with somewhat iridescent white fur, a result of it forking a few too many times in order to shift its sensorium to try and forget a fact. It is described as wearing natty, fanciful dress, whether that be a tux, dress, or whatever. It has opted out of gender.

It is in a relationship with Codrin Bălan and one other unnamed individual.

She takes the form of a short, chubby anthropomorphic skunk, and is the author of the well-received *An Expanded Mythology of Our World*. She falls in love easily and deeply, and her primary instance is in a relationship with Ioan Bălan, though several long-running forks remain in relationships with others. She dresses for comfort.

#### The Only Time I Know My *True Name* is When I Dream<span class="spoiler"> / Sasha</span><i class="spoiler-warn"></i> (she/her)

True Name is a politician and one of the movers and shakers of the System as one of the Founders and member of the Council of Eight. She takes the form of an anthropomorphic skunk, though is taller and slimmer than her up-tree instance, May Then My Name. She is described wearing rather nice clothes; blouses and skirts or slacks.

She is/was in an on-again-off-again relationship with Zacharias, a dapper, snarky red fox.

Ey's described as of average height, a little soft, and with tousled blond hair.
