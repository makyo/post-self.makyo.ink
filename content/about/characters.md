As the Post-Self universe contains billions, you're perfectly free to create your own characters to live, work, love, and hate within the setting. The following are those included in the canon, which you are welcome to use.

Spoilers for the Post-Self Cycle itself are marked as such: <span class="spoiler">Yikes!</span><i class="spoiler-warn"></i>. Hover to expose the spoiler.

## RJ Brewster / AwDae (ey/em)

## Dr. Carter Ramirez (she/her)

## Michelle Hadje<span class="spoiler"> / Sasha</span><i class="spoiler-warn"></i>

Michelle Hadje uploaded early on during the System's creation and is considered one of the founders and a member of the Council of Eight along with Debarre, Zeke/Ezekiel, Jonas Anderson, user11824, and the three nameless Sino-Russian Bloc representatives.

She is best known for being the founder of the Ode clade, and is no longer extant on the System as of 2306.

Due to her experience while lost, her and her up-tree instances have a 'unique relationship to language' that primarily manifests with a lack of contractions, florid speech with occasionally irregular word order (dative or ablative fronting, e.g: "I set up *for myself* an archetype"), and well-chosen uses of the word 'fuck'. She and her clade deal with the effects even within the System and will occasionally describe themselves as 'mad', for lack of a better term. <span class="spoiler">Additionally, the experience left her struggling to maintain a single form post-uploading, often alternating between skunk and human form, which is described as extremely unpleasant.</span><i class="spoiler-warn"></i>

### The Ode clade

The Ode clade consists of, nominally, 100 instances. In 2124, Michelle forked ten instances from herself corresponding to the ten first lines of the stanzas of the "Ode to the end of death". From there, those ten instances were free to fork as they would, and each quickly picked up on interests as they went.
