## Book I - Qoheleth

[![Qoheleth](/img/qoheleth.png)](https://qoheleth.makyo.ink)

> “All artists search. I search for stories, in this post-self age.  What happens when you can no longer call yourself an individual, when  you have split your sense of self among several instances? How do you  react? Do you withdraw into yourself, become a hermit? Do you expand  until you lose all sense of identity? Do you fragment? Do you go about  it deliberately, or do you let nature and chance take their course?”

With  immersive technology at its peak, it's all too easy to get lost. When  RJ loses emself in that virtual world, not only must ey find eir way  out, but find all the answers ey can along the way.

## Book II - Toledot

> "I am saying that you trust me — really trust me — and that life in the System is more subtle than I think you know. You let me into your dreams, my dear, and your dreams influence this place as much as, if not more than, your waking mind."

No longer bound to the physical, what lengths should one go to in a virtual world to ensure the continuity of one's existence?

Secession. Launch. Two separations from two societies, two hundred years apart. And through it all, so many parallels run on so many levels that it can be dizzying just keeping up. The more Ioan and Codrin Bălan learn, the more it calls into question the motivations of even those they hold most dear.
