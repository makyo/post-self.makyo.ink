[![Qoheleth](/img/qoheleth.png)](https://qoheleth.makyo.ink)

> “All artists search. I search for stories, in this post-self age.  What happens when you can no longer call yourself an individual, when  you have split your sense of self among several instances? How do you  react? Do you withdraw into yourself, become a hermit? Do you expand  until you lose all sense of identity? Do you fragment? Do you go about  it deliberately, or do you let nature and chance take their course?”

With  immersive technology at its peak, it's all too easy to get lost. When  RJ loses emself in that virtual world, not only must ey find eir way  out, but find all the answers ey can along the way.
